    <h2>Method of Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.</p>
            <p>duce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. </p>
            <p>Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil</p>
            <p>Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
